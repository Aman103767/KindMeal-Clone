## Challenges

1.As every journey has some challenges and so was ours.On first day we don't know about anyone.What is our weakness and stronge areas.
it was very hard to give right thing to right person.

2.In our website we don't have cart page so we have to build one from scratch. It was very hard to 
decide format of cart page.

3.Another problem was to merge all of the files in a proper sequence which was again a difficult task for us because while merging 
and connecting all the pages some of the pages had the same name, and while running the site it was redirecting to some other pages so it was difficult to find the location and to rename the file.
 
 4.We faced challenges with CSS tags and class also, because when we merged CSS files for any page in which 2-3 members have worked, sometimes tags were colliding because of the same names of tags and classes.
